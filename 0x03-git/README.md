# Project Git

Answer some questions, with just the commands. 
* To start, we create a new directory, which is the current one.
* Then, new directories (bash, c, js) and files are created.
* Create a branch *update_script* and in this branch create a new file and replace the information in two other files. Then, I went back to the main branch and deleted the *js* directory.
